by Ralph Dumain</font></b></P><P>I remember being strongly affected by the presentation 
of Ray Bradbury's <I>The Martian Chronicles </I>on television about two decades 
ago. I still have a few notes made on 28 January 1980, on a theological dialogue 
between two priests on Mars. While I recognize the dialogue, that scene was not 
included in the broadcast I taped off the air several years later, which suggests 
I might have taped a butchered version of the original program. But there is also 
a note on what was for me the most memorable scene of the entire drama.</P><P>After 
watching this program on television, I dug out the original book, and I could 
not find the scene I wanted to look up. I repeated this attempt about a month 
ago, to no avail. I concluded that the scene in question must have been added 
by whoever wrote the teleplay, which turns out to be Richard Matheson, celebrated 
science fiction author, screenwriter, and writer of classic episodes of the TV 
series <I>The Twilight Zone</I>. </P><P>Ray Bradbury also made a stage play out 
of <I>The Martian Chronicles</I> (Woodstock, IL: The Dramatic Publishing Company, 
1986). (It is rumored that he has been working on a screenplay as well.) This 
play is by far the sketchiest and to me least satisfactory version of the story, 
though there is one more expedition, as well as scenes involving the settlers, 
than appear in the television version I have on tape, which is what I will report 
on from here on in.</P><P>Comparing this television play to the contemporary run 
of video science fiction, one finds <I>The Martian Chronicles</I> extremely "deficient" 
in special effects, with a concentration on serious themes instead of the blockbuster 
spectacles that now monopolize the attention of the infantile American audience. 
Most of the background is very ordinary and not very futuristic. The Martians 
are bald, with slightly aglow eyes and no ears, and they sport simple white robes. 
The Martian cities are composed of abstract geometric shapes such as spheres and 
cones, in stone. The story begins at a very slow pace by today's standards, though 
it ceases to drag once we are in the thick of the expeditions. There are several 
voice-overs, a technique not much in use these days, but some of Bradbury's poetic 
prose is thus preserved. The haunting spacey theme music is by Stanley Myers.</P><P>Whatever 
there is to carp on from a contemporary technical perspective, Bradbury's thematic 
richness comes through undiluted, even expanded by Matheson's script while some 
of the plot developments of the original chronicles are omitted. A half-century 
ago Bradbury gave us a damning critique of American society in the guise of science 
fiction (as he was to continue in <I>Fahrenheit 451</I>): the crassness, small-mindedness, 
blind ambition and greed, militarism, witch hunts (omitted in this teleplay,) 
spiritual emptiness, nervous preoccupation with mindless partying and compulsive 
distraction that we dare to call "fun," obtuseness to impending destruction, and 
a scandalous lack of curiosity about the cultures of the indigenous populations 
we exterminated while colonizing our own land.</P><P>"Part One: The Expeditions" 
includes three exploratory expeditions to Mars. The first crew is killed by a 
husband (probably out of jealousy) concerned by the dreams his wife is having 
over the Earthmen who are just arriving and whom no Martian has yet encountered. 
When the second expedition arrives, the crew comes upon a midwestern American 
town mysteriously transplanted to Mars, complete with the crewmen's relatives, 
some of which were deceased on Earth. Though totally mystified, the crewmen are 
seduced by the ministrations of their "relatives." Captain Black only comes to 
his senses when he is about to go to sleep, in bed in the same room with his "brother" 
Skip. Black guesses that all the people in the town are Martians in disguise defending 
themselves the only way they know how, by recreating familiar scenes telepathically 
borrowed from the memories of the Earth "invaders." Skip completes the story for 
Black and reveals his true Martian appearance, but it is too late for Black, as 
he collapses dead from the poison he ingested with his dinner. The next day, the 
Martians, still in the guise of Earth people, now dressed in black, conduct a 
traditional Earth burial for the crewmen they have killed, and then disappear.</P><P>Back 
on Earth, Mission Control has been totally baffled by the disappearance of the 
first two crews, but a third mission is sent to Mars, this one headed at last 
by Capt. Wilder (Rock Hudson). A couple of his crewmen are typical crass American 
ignoramuses, but there is a thoughtful black crewman, Spender (Bernie Casey), 
who is full of doubts from the beginning about the impending colonization of Mars. 
Wilder is a thoughtful man himself, but dismisses those doubts. "What's wrong 
with colonization?" he asks innocently, whereupon Spender gives him a look. On 
Mars, the crew finds only the ruins of a dead city, but no Earth explorers and 
no Martians. Spender is very troubled and goes exploring on his own, and concludes 
that the Martians were accidentally wiped out by a plague brought on by contact 
with the Earthmen: the Martians died of chicken pox. Spender is infuriated by 
the crass indifference to the extermination of a whole civilization, and disappears. 
He has since spent his time teaching himself about the Martian civilization, and 
now identifies with the Martians. He kills three of his crewmen with a Martian 
weapon. Later, following a standoff with Wilder and the cowboy-character Parkhill, 
Spender explains to Wilder why he has chosen to kill off the crew in order to 
keep Mars safe from Earth contamination for another half-century. Wilder refuses 
to join him. Spender intimates that there are still surviving Martians. Spender 
implores Wilder to protect Mars if he wins the fight. During a subsequent attack 
from Spender, Wilder is forced to kill him.</P><P>As "Part Two: The Settlers" 
commences, the inevitable colonization of Mars is implemented, with Wilder as 
the Chief Coordinator.</P><P>Two years later, late at night, an elderly couple 
is lying in bed. Leif Lustig hears a noise, and when he goes outside in the rain 
to investigate, he sees an apparition of his son David, who had disappeared in 
the second expedition. "David" rejoins the family the next morning. Mrs. Emma 
Lustig, who had rejected the apparition the night before, now treats David as 
a normal member of the family, while her husband, who had encouraged the apparition 
to approach, is extremely disturbed by his reappearance. Leif suspects that David 
is an imposter and David flees the scene. After a long disappearance, he returns, 
presumably prompted by Leif's unspoken wish for him to come back. This time Leif 
doesn't make any trouble about David's reappearance. Emma insists that the whole 
family go into town that night, even though David panics at the prospect. The 
night life in the Mars colony is very vigorous, and thrust into it, David panics 
and then disappears into the crowd. Then Leif goes to look for him, encountering 
Wilder in the process, who becomes disturbed by their conversation about Leif's 
missing son.</P><P>The following scene, with Father Peregrine in the church, is 
the one that most indelibly impressed itself upon me, which is why I decided to 
review this production after all this time. I have attempted to describe the scene 
and transcribe the dialogue, which you will find at the end of this piece.</P><P>Now 
I want to skip ahead to what follows after. Wilder visits Father Peregrine, whereupon 
it becomes evident that there is a Martian changeling at large in the town, assuming 
human form.</P><P>Leif Lustig, in search of his son, learns of the mysterious 
reappearance of another lost loved one, Lavinia. He visits her family's house 
and confronts "Lavinia," urging her to return with him as David. Lavinia tries 
to ward off Lustig, but is trapped. After a conflict ensues between the two fathers, 
Lavinia turns into David and runs off with Leif. Everyone is closing in on David 
as Wilder comes on the scene. David, after running through the crowds by himself, 
catches up to his "parents," but others who have a claim on him converge on his 
location, and he rapidly changes from one person to another: to Lavinia, a killer 
being chased by a policeman, someone's husband, and back to David. Wilder intervenes, 
identifying the changeling as a Martian. The Martian can't take the stress any 
longer and dies an agonizing death, assuming each of his guises and finally dying 
in his original Martian form, and then vanishes. Wilder is stunned.</P><P>There 
is a threat of world war back on Earth.</P><P>Wilder visits Parkhill and his wife 
to warn him of impending disaster. Parkhill is dressed up as a cowboy this time, 
and he has opened his dream diner to sell his weenies and burgers to nonexistent 
customers. He refuses to believe the news about Earth, insisting that the next 
wave of migration will make him rich once the customers start pouring in. Parkhill 
is as much an ignorant redneck as he was on the third expedition. Wilder gives 
up and leaves.</P><P>Parkhill is alone, and he hears a customer enter. But it 
is a Martian. Parkhill panics and shoots him dead. The Martian vaporizes and his 
cloak, mask, and a silver box fall to the floor. Parkhill's wife is distraught, 
but Parkhill just makes lame excuses. A fleet of Martians appear over the hill 
sailing their sand ships. Parkhill assumes they are out for revenge, and forces 
his wife to flee with him in a sand ship he had found long ago but had never before 
piloted. During the chase, Parkhill shoots several Martians, but they overtake 
him. Instead of exacting revenge, one of the Martians speaks to him in English 
and hands him a treaty, granting him a huge tract of Martian land, and warning 
him to prepare for tonight.</P><P>That night there is an atomic war on Earth and 
the Earth population is wiped out.</P><P>Six months later Wilder returns to see 
Parkhill. Wilder had been away, visiting Earth, but the family members he hoped 
in vain to save, along with everyone else, are dead. Wilder hears about Parkhill's 
encounter and the land grant for the first time, and he is exasperated that he 
yet again missed his long-sought opportunity to meet and talk with and learn from 
a Martian at last, while this obtuse and ignorant cowboy blithely turned his encounter 
with the Martians into a massacre. Wilder comes to a sudden realization of what 
Spender had been trying to get him to understand, and Parkhill is alarmed at such 
subversive extremist views. Wilder leaves and drives off to the abandoned Martian 
city.</P><P>As Wilder strides through the old Martian city, a Martian approaches, 
and greets him in Martian before adjusting himself to speak English. Wilder's 
dream of meeting a live Martian has come true, but when he extends his hand, it 
goes right through the Martian. The two are ghosts to each other, and see only 
their own worlds, not the world the other sees. Wilder is troubled, but the Martian 
tells him it hardly matters which civilization is alive and which dead, which 
is the past and which the future. Wilder is anxious to learn from the Martian, 
to learn the secret of the Martian way of life, and he is frustrated. The Martian 
explains:</P><blockquote> <p>"Secret …. There is no secret. Anyone with eyes can 
see the way to live …. By watching life, observing nature, and cooperating with 
it. Making common cause with the process of existence …. By living life for itself, 
don't you see? Deriving pleasure from the gift of pure being .… Life is its own 
answer. Accept it and enjoy it day by day. Live as well as possible. Expect no 
more. Destroy nothing, humble nothing, look for fault in nothing. Leave unsullied 
and untouched all that is beautiful. Hold that which lives in all reverence. For 
life is given by the sovereign of our universe; given to be savored, to be luxuriated 
in, to be respected. But that's no secret. You're intelligent. You know as well 
as I what has to be done."</p></blockquote><P>The Martian and the Earthman part 
as friends. </P><P>At home, Wilder's children are bored. When Wilder arrives home, 
his wife is worried, but Wilder explains his new realization. They have been hanging 
on to the old way of life in futility. Wilder announces that the family is leaving. 
While Wilder is gone to make some preparations, his wife goes into the playroom 
to tell the children to pack for a camping trip, in view of the huge American 
flag attached to the wall. The family piles into a boat and goes on a long ride 
down the canal. After a while, Wilder asks his two children where they want to 
stop. They agree to stop at the lost city. Wilder announces that this is their 
new home. He has promised all along to take his children to see Martians, and 
they repeatedly ask about the Martians. As they make a campfire at night, Wilder 
tosses some old papers and books into the fire (including a book with the word 
"Capital" on the cover), explaining that he is burning what is being left behind, 
a way of life. He announces to his eager children that they are now going to see 
Martians. He leads his family to the edge of the water. He points downward, and 
says, "There. Those are the Martians." They look down and see their reflections 
in the water. </P><P>Reaching into his pocket, Wilder pulls out a remote control 
device, and pressing a button, blows up the rocket in the distance that had brought 
them from Earth.</P><P>I don't think I have ever been more moved by a dramatic 
presentation of a science fiction tale. And I have never forgotten that phrase, 
"the gift of pure being."</P><P>All that is left to do is to present my transcription 
of the brilliant scene as promised, an encounter between Father Peregrine and 
the Martian changeling on the run. This is one of those rare moments in which 
the visual presentation of science fiction (a very different beast from the literary 
genre) really does challenge our philosophical foundations, in this case the selfishness 
of religious belief.</P><hr> <P ALIGN="CENTER"><b>Scene in Church</b></P><P>The 
door to the church opens. Father Peregrine is at the altar. He hears something, 
goes to close the door. Father Peregrine returns to kneel and pray at the altar, 
then turns around and looks for an intruder. </P><P>"Someone there?"</P><P>He 
approaches a water basin in the center of the room, sees blood dripping into the 
water. He sees a hand bearing the stigmata, then the other, and begins to pray 
intensely with eyes clenched shut.</P><P>"Enough." Father Peregrine covers his 
face with his hands.</P><P>'Jesus' appears, in a robe, with arms crossed and folded, 
with a crown of thorns. Father Peregrine reaches out his hand. Then he mutters 
"You're trembling ..."</P><P><I>'Jesus' says:</i> "Let me go."</P><P><I>Peregrine:</i> 
"Let you go? But no one keeps you here."</P><P><I>'Jesus':</i> "Yes …. you do."</P><P><I>'Jesus'</i>: 
"Avert your gaze. The more you look, the more I become this. I am not what I seem. 
I'm not that vision. I didn't mean to come here. I was in the town square. One 
thing: I lost hold … and suddenly I was many things to many people. I ran and 
they followed. I fled in here. Then you came in. And I was trapped."</P><P><I>Peregrine:</i> 
"No…. no…."</P><P><I>Martian Jesus:</i> "Yes … trapped!"</P><P><I>Peregrine:</i> 
"But … you're not what you seem?"</P><P><I>Martian Jesus:</i> "Forgive me. I wish

Jesus:</i> "No … or I go down in madness with you. Release me!"</P><P><I>Peregrine:</i>

"You see nothing but your own dream ... your own needs. Beneath all this I am 
another thing."</P><P><I>Peregrine:</i> "What am I to do?"</P><P><I>Martian Jesus:</i>

"Or I'll kill you?"</P><P><I>Martian Jesus:</i> "If you force me into this guise 
much longer, I will die. This is more than I can hold."</P><P>Father Peregrine

"…Oh, my sweet God …. Go, before I keep you here forever."</P><P>Father Peregrine 
turns away. The door opens; the wind blows. 'Jesus' is gone. The priest turns 
back around: no one is there.</P><hr> <p align="center">Written 31 July - 2 August

Ralph Dumain</font></p><hr> <p align="center"><b><font size="+1">Addendum</font></b></p><p>When 
I transcribed the scene above, I erroneously assumed that this scene must have 
been Matheson's own creation, and that there was no way to obtain this story in 
print, as screenplays can be very hard to come by. Thanks to Ray Bradbury fans, 
I have learned that the scene above was indeed based on a short story by Bradbury, 
though not part of <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>. Apparently, there are enough 
other Martian stories to make up another volume. The basis for this scene is evidently 
Bradbury's story &quot;The Messiah&quot;, which appears in the collection <i>Long 
After Midnight</i> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1976; pp. 55-66). The story begins 
with a theological dialogue between Father Niven and Bishop Kelley. Father Niven 
has the encounter with the Martian 'Jesus' in the wee hours. There is more to 
the dialogue here than in the screenplay, as Father Niven exacts a promise from 
the Martian Jesus to return once a year, on Easter. I think this ending derogates 
from the story. I do not know how Richard Matheson came to include this story 
in his teleplay. One of my informants claims that Bradbury wrote some of the additional 
scenes and dialogue for the miniseries, but I have not as yet been able to verify 
Bradbury's direct input. The miniseries is available as a three-volume VHS video, 
and can easily be found via online auction web sites. (<i>Ralph Dumain, 17 May 
2003</i>)</p><hr> <p align="center"><b><font size="+1">Take Two</font></b></p><p>After 
acquiring the miniseries on video (StarMaker #1215, VHS, 3 tapes, 296 min.), I 
finally had the chance to see it uncut, perhaps for the first time in 23 years.  
I suggest that any of you who have seen any of the rebroadcasts or any tapes made 
off the air, get hold of this uncut video.  Indeed, the tape I worked with when 
I wrote my original review was a butchered version of the miniseries.  How much 
was lost?  </p><p>There are three parts to the miniseries, each approximately 
98 minutes in length: (1) The Expeditions, (2) The Settlers, (3) The Martians.  
The first part appears to be intact.  </p><p>Part two is where the most damaging 
cuts were made, all of which involve the adventures of Fathers Peregrine and Stone 
after they arrive on Mars.  Their scenes are sandwiched in between two segments 
of the late David Lustig’s reappearance at his parents’ house, between the moment 
he flees after “his” father expresses his suspicions about his real identity and 
the moment David returns, leading to his fatal excursion into town with “his” 
parents.  The tale of the priests is based upon Bradbury’s short story “The Fire 
Balloons”, excised from the original edition of <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> 
and restored for the first time in the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary edition (New 
York: Doubleday, 1990; pp. 90-108), and anthologized again thereafter.</p><p>Upon 
introduction to Col. Wilder, Fr. Peregrine explains his mission, but he also harbors 
a personal curiosity about the Martians.  He enquires concerning a rumor about 
blue spheres, but no substantiation is forthcoming.  Peregrine wants to exchange 
ideas with Martians if any can be found.  He wants to see the old Martian cities.  
Wilder compares Mars to the Wild West: colonization is proceeding too abruptly, 
there is too much corruption, and spiritual guidance is needed.  Wilder confides 
in the priests: he wonders if the Spender who attacked his fellow members of the 
third expedition was the real Spender.  Perhaps there are still Martians afoot.  
Wilder shows them the ruins of a Martian city.  Pieces of it are being dismantled 
to be sent back to Earth.  While others drive back to the Earth settlement, the 
priests stay behind, choosing to walk back on their own.  Fr. Peregrine is actually 
the one who takes charge.</p><p>The two priests debate theological issues as they 
hike back to home base.  By dusk they are lost.  Three blue spheres appear.  Stone 
is afraid, convinced it’s the devil’s work.  Peregrine is unafraid; he tries to 
communicate, showing his cross.  The spheres depart.  But Peregrine’s shouting 
appears to provoke an avalanche. As rocks rain down from the mountainside, the 
priests prostrate themselves on the ground, fearing the worst.  But a blue sphere 
descends from the sky, picks them up, and moves them to a safe spot.  Peregrine 
is elated: this proves that the spheres have souls and free will.  Stone as usual 
wants to limit his attention to Earth souls that need saving; he is averse to 
non-human creatures.  Peregrine asks: “Can’t you recognize the human in the inhuman?”  
Stone replies: “I would rather recognize the inhuman in the human.”</p><p>This 
exchange typifies their contrasting attitudes.  They camp for the night.  Peregrine 
argues that the blue spheres know sin and moral life and have free will.  He argues 
that saving Earthmen is the Martians’ atonement for their original sin of killing 
the members of the first expeditions.  Stone thinks Peregrine has his own interests 
at heart, committing the sin of pride.  Peregrine confesses that his initial motivation 
to become a priest was to meet Christ in person.</p><p>This confession sets up 
the assumptions behind Peregrine’s later encounter with the Martian changeling.</p><p>Wilder 
is preoccupied with troubles in the colony caused by lax immigration controls.  
He sends out a search party for the missing priests.</p><p>The priests spend the 
night on the cliff.  Around dawn the blue spheres descend, and Peregrine awakens.  
While Stone sleeps, Peregrine sets out to prove that the spheres are intelligent.  
He jumps off the cliff, but instead of plunging to his death, he is saved in mid-fall 
by a sphere, as he anticipated.  Overjoyed, Peregrine tells the sphere he will 
build a church for the Martians with a blue sphere instead of a cross.  The sphere 
identifies itself and its fellows as the Old Ones, who have no bodies and are 
immortal, living in grace, each a temple unto itself, and having no need of any 
church or salvation, unlike Earthmen.</p><p>Afterwards, Peregrine awakens Stone 
and tells him the story, emphasizing that he heard His voice.  The voice-over 
narration concludes that there is a truth on every planet and that the priests’ 
Christianity is a partial truth in the mosaic of a larger truth to be discovered.</p><p>The 
contrast between Peregrine’s affirmative, expansive attitude and Stone’s narrowed, 
negative attitude gives this tale a large part of its interest.  I find Peregrine’s 
expression of faith noteworthy. For all the talk of sin and seeking after Christ, 
he has a positive attitude toward the Martian spheres, derived, I would say, not 
from any faith in God apart from people but from faith in his fellow intelligent 
creatures. In effect, Peregrine jumps off the cliff placing his faith in the good 
will of the spheres.</p><p>The rest of the second part proceeds as I originally 
described.  I think the series suffers with this part cut out.  However, more 
than half of part three was cut out in my abridged version, approximately the 
first hour.  While the narrative advances quite smoothly without the subplots 
contained in the missing scenes, they do reinforce key themes in certain ways.</p><p>Wilder’s 
space ship lands on planet Earth after it has been devastated by world war.  He 
finds the space command center abandoned, and is anguished when he plays back 
the videotape of the final moments of its personnel before the fatal atomic blast.</p><p>Apparently, 
before the Earth Holocaust took place, a large majority of settlers abandoned 
the Martian colony, apparently to perish back on Earth.  There are stray colonists 
who remain on Mars, living in isolation from one another.  The first one we see 
is Ben Driscoll, skulking about the ghost town he lives in.  He hears a couple 
of phones ring, but there is no one on the other end.  He finds a phone book and 
proceeds to call every number in it, finally succeeding in reaching a live person, 
Genevieve (played by Bernadette Peters).   He hops into his one-man flight vehicle 
and makes a beeline to her settlement.</p><p>The next scene finds another isolated 
survivor, Peter Hathaway (played by Barry Morse), looking at the sky through his 
telescope.  He spots the space ship he had long hoped to see.  Excited, he informs 
his wife Alice and daughter Marguerite.  He sends up flares but fails to make 
contact.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ben finds Genevieve dressed to the nines and looking 
ravishing.  They are the only two left alive as far as they know.  He asks her 
for a date; she accepts.  They go out on a formal date in an elegant but deserted 
restaurant.  He is a bit shy.  She is vain, playing games.  He cooks for her while 
she preens, constantly primping and looking in the mirror.  They dine.  At the 
end of the evening, she rebuffs his advances, but this glamour girl is happy to 
have him around, as she needs a servant, a cook, and a handyman.</p><p>Disillusioned, 
Ben hops into this flight vehicle and puts as much distance between Genevieve 
and himself as he can.  After over a week of flying, he succeeds in putting 10,000 
miles between them.</p><p>Peter Hathaway and his family are up at night again.  
Again, he spots a rocket, sends up flares, and this time the rocket lands.  In 
joyous anticipation, Hathaway begins to pack, telling his family he couldn’t make 
it without them.  In the morning, Wilder and Stone arrive at his home.  Wilder 
suspects things are not as they seem, as Hathaway’s wife has not aged and the 
daughter is a different age than she should be.  While Stone takes over the conversation, 
Wilder ducks out to look around, and finds the graves of the real wife and daughter.  
Wilder rejoins the household.  While toasting his good fortune, Hathaway has a 
heart attack and dies, his final words being that his family won’t understand.  
The wife and daughter are impassive.  They were not taught to cry.  They are androids, 
built by Hathaway to assuage his loneliness.</p><p>Wilder and Stone bury Hathaway.  
They debate about what to do with the androids, who have not been programmed to 
serve any other function.  Wilder is inclined to take the androids away, but Stone 
insists that they remain where they are, which would respect “the decision of 
their creator.”  They have the right to live the lives they were created to have.  
“Their souls belong to Hathaway.”</p><p>Wilder and Stone say goodbye, and depart.  
The androids sit around the table, just waiting.  Ben Driscoll shows up at the 
door.  His needs are simple; he just needs a home and family.  The androids now 
know what to do.</p><p>Next, Wilder visits Parkhill, learns of the land grant 
from the Martians, and the story proceeds as I have described.</p><p>These restored 
subplots help to reinforce central themes of the whole story.  Though Hathaway’s 
“family” turns out to be androids rather than Martians in disguise, the existence 
of the androids raises the now-familiar existential questions about the moral 
nature of intelligent life, cast by Fr. Stone in terms of the relationship between 
creature and creator.  This is another way of creating a distancing perspective 
from the familiar habits, mores, and assumptions of Earth culture.</p><p>The central 
purpose of these subplots evidently is to show the futility of hanging on to the 
old ways imported from Earth.  What could be more ritualistic and pointless than 
the assumptions upon which the date between Ben and Genevieve takes place?  Ben 
thinks he is going to play Adam and Eve; Genevieve acts like a narcissistic prima 
donna in total disregard of the reality of her situation.  Ben comes to the correct 
conclusion, getting as far away from her as possible, a very satisfying resolution 
for this viewer.  Then Ben stumbles onto the android family and finds a home.  
In his way Hathaway tries to hang on to the Earth’s dead past, in the persons 
of his own deceased loved ones.  All of this reinforces the central theme of this 
final installment of the miniseries, Wilder’s decision to leave Earth ways behind 
and begin a new life.</p><p>Viewing this series in its entirety, as with the abridged 
version, is a powerful experience.  While it lacks the fast pace and snazzy special 
effects we take for granted today, when it comes to science fiction on screen 
it is virtually unparalleled in its human content.  Why does its message for us 
to change our ways hit home as so few other productions do?  My guess is that 
it is not because of the strangeness of Mars but because of the familiarity and 
utter conventionality of the characters, their lives, and our society transplanted 
to an imagined location.  The analogy to the colonization of America could not 
be more conspicuous, as well as the all-too-familiar meaningless distractions 
of modern life and the smallness of people’s dreams.</p><p>What hit home this 
time even harder was Wilder’s dream that pervades the whole story: to meet the 
Martians, learn from them, and to improve the ways of the human race.  Even as 
an instrument of colonization he anticipates the best and only understands later 
the truth of Spender’s warning as he strives to keep his promise to the dying 
Spender not to let Earth ruin Mars.  In self-defense the Martians feel compelled 
to resort to murder.  They are accidentally and absurdly wiped out by a plague.  
As a result, the survivors adapt themselves to Earth people, either by ceding 
them land or taking on the disguise of Earth people to live among them and become 
part of them.  When the Martians realize that Earth is destroying itself, they 
decide to give the survivors a second chance, a chance to start over.  Wilder 
finally understands this, as he explains to the alarmed redneck Parkhill, and 
pursues his hope for a new synthesis of human and Martian ways.  When Wilder finally 
meets a live Martian, he learns that their worlds cannot quite touch one another.  
The Martian cannot see his world nor can Wilder see the Martian’s.  The Martian 
asks him: how do you know you are seeing the ruins of our past civilization and 
not the ruins of your future one?  They part as friends, but they cannot share 
their lives. After having been told he knows what must be done, Wilder takes his 
last, bold step.  He realizes his fellow colonists are stuck in the past. He packs 
up his family, boats to a Martian city, to &quot;where it all started,&quot; and 
tells his wife and children they are all going to learn the Martian language, 
study the Martian ways, and learn the secret of the way to live.  And finally, 
when asked to deliver on his promise to see the Martians, he points at the canal, 
and, looking down into the water, they see their own reflections.  Is there anything 
else in visual science fiction to affect us so deeply, so intimately, and yet 
with such simplicity?  No, there is nothing like this. May we all learn to &quot;take 
pleasure from the gift of pure being.&quot; </p><p><i>Ralph Dumain, 1 June 2003</i></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><hr><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradbury,_Ray">Ray
